## About

Hi,
Welcome to my personal page. I am a Market Risk Analyst at Credit Suisse. I have completed my MSc in Economics from BITS Pilani in 2015. I have worked in National Council for Applied Economic Research as a Research Analyst intern. I am interested in investment analysis, behavioral finance and financial markets. In my free time, I like to enjoy playing and watching football.
